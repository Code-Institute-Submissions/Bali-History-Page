<h2>The Temple's construction</h2>
<p>
    The temple has several holy springs that are said to have been created by The God Indra and blessed to purify those who bath there.
    <br />The temple was founded in 926 A.D and the creation of this breathtaking site is based on a manuscript called Usana Bali. The manuscript contains a myth of an epic battle between a wicked King 
    <br />named Mayadenawa and the God Indra. The wicked king did not believe in God and forbid his subjects to Worship God. He was drunk on his power and carelessly used black magic.
    <br />A priest seeing the pain, suffering and chaos that the King had wrought prayed to Indra to put an end to the evil King.</p>
