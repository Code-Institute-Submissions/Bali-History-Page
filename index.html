    <div id="The Temple's Construction">
        <h2>The Temple's Construction</h2>
        <p>
            The temple has several holy springs that are said to have been created by The God Indra and blessed to purify those who bath there.
            <br />The temple was founded in 926 A.D and the creation of this breathtaking site is based on a manuscript called Usana Bali. The manuscript contains a myth of an epic battle between a wicked King
            <br />named Mayadenawa and the God Indra. The wicked king did not believe in God and forbid his subjects to Worship God. He was drunk on his power and carelessly used black magic.
            <br />A priest seeing the pain, suffering and chaos that the King had wrought prayed to Indra to put an end to the evil King.
            <br />Indra came with his warriors to attack and dethrone the evil king. Mayadenawa fled with his troops to the north of the island to a village called Tampak Siring.
            <br />The Wicked king's devious stratagy was to sneak into Indra's camp where his army was in a deep sleep and create a beautiful but poisonous spring that Indra's army would drink from when they rose
            <br />from their slumber.
        </p>
        <p>
            To not leave any foot prints the wicked King snuck into the camp walking on the sides off his feet. This is believed to be the origin of the name of the village from which the King fled to in the north
            <br /> as Tampak Siring translates to tilted footprint. When morning came Indra found his army poisoned to death but using his godly powers he peirced the ground creating a healing spring.
            <br />The water from this holy spring showered over his poisoned army, purified them and brought them back from death.And thus the name of the temple was born, Tirta Empul, The Holy Spring Temple.
            <br />The King knowing that his plans had failed transformed himself into many different beings while being chased by Indra until the King transformed himself into a boulder and Indra shot through
            <br />the boulder killing the evil king Mayadenawa. Blood is said to have gushed from the King and Petanu River, and for over a thousand years, the river was cursed making rice grow rapidly, but
            <br />having an awful reek of blood. The Balanises people comemorate the death of the King every 210 days to celebrate when virtue triumphs over evil. The ceremony is called Galungan.
